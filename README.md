# Course-Scheduler-Project

This Program uses Aoache netbeans UI to create a platform that helps in organizing and managing courses, classes, and schedules within an educational institution. It is designed to automate the process of scheduling courses, assigning classrooms, and managing student enrollment.

By integrating an SQL database with Apache NetBeans, you can store and retrieve data efficiently, allowing the admin to manage semesters, add courses and students, and display relevant information. Additionally, students can use the application to select their classes, view their selections, and see their waitlist or scheduling status.

Example of how the UI looks like:
